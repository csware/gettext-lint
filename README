This packages includes the following tools:
POFileStatus - validator and status reporting
POFileChecker - searches for common mistakes in PO/POT files
POFileConsistency - consistency checker
POFileEquiv - glossary generator
POFileSpell - spell checker
POFileFill - fill a file with entries already translated in other files

All the commands produce XML output; you can feed this output to report.xsl
(probably located on /usr/share/gettext-lint/report.xsl) to generate
HTML reports. For example:

POFileChecker $(find /path/to/po/files -name "*.po") | xsltproc /usr/share/gettext-lint/report.xsl - > report.html

The included XSL can receive the parameter 'css' with the name of a stylesheet
to reference in the resulting HTML. For example:

POFileChecker $(find /path/to/po/files -name "*.po") | xsltproc -param css "'/usr/share/gettext-lint/report.css'" /usr/share/gettext-lint/report.xsl - > report.html

You can also run POFileSpell and POFileConsistency in interactive mode,
following a series of prompts. The -i option chooses this mode.
